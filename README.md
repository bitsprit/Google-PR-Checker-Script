Google-PR-Checker-Script
========================

Google PR Checker Script to check page rank of all pages within site. Generally we check page rank of website domain i.e. www.sitename.com . And maximum page rank checker sites provide info only about the URL we input in the form.  This is the main reason why I developed Google PR Checker Script  to check the PR of all the pages within site in one click. (Description of this script is available on http://blogbl.com).
